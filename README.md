# Project: TheForsakenSoldier/comp-assesment

Welcome to the repository for the comp-assesment project! This project is a comprehensive assessment tool designed to provide a financial outlook over a company based on a specific ticker. It is designed to be a friendly and informative resource for anyone interested in understanding the financial health of a company.

## Project Structure

- `backend/Code/data`: Contains the data of the companies that you look for
- `backend/Code/web`: contains the resources for the web application (so far just two images)
- `backend/Code`: This directory contains the main project that I worked on. Two files are the main "brains" of the project, `app.py` and `rest.api.py`.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, you should navigate to the `backend/Code` directory and execute the `rest.api.py` script. This script is responsible for activating the main project and enabling all its functionalities, it will create a web app in https://127.0.0.1:8050, it dosent do much yet but soon there will be many functionalities in it.
